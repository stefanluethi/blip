Release notes
=============

What changed in each release of blip, the outpost and sonde, and what to do
when upgrading. The newest release is at the top. Each release lists what is
new, what changed, what was removed, and under **Upgrading** what you have to
change, e.g. in scripts, schemas, layout or recording files.

0.1.0 (not released yet)
------------------------

The first release.

blip
   * Plots, states, tables, XY plots, heatmaps, logs and actions views,
     arranged in tabs and groups, saved and opened as layout files.
   * One time range for all views: live, paused or playing, with a time cursor
     and a timeline of all data.
   * Records with fields, arrays of one and two dimensions, units, display
     formats, and stats of the traces below plots.
   * Recording, saved compressed to ``.blip`` files and opened again.
   * Actions with buttons, checkboxes, sliders, fields and choices, carried
     out only while recording.
   * Connections to several outposts at once; in the browser and native.

outpost
   * The Python library ``blip_outpost`` for scripts that connect a target:
     values, records, log records, actions, recording.
   * The ``blip-outpost`` command: pass through targets that speak the blip
     protocol over TCP or UDP, translate protobuf targets from an annotated
     schema, replay recordings.
   * Examples: a simulator, the smallest script, and a stress test.

sonde
   * The C++17 library for firmware and unit tests: values, records, arrays and
     log records in batches, sent by the firmware or written to recording
     files by a sink.

Upgrading
   Layouts saved by blip before this release are migrated when opened; the
   versions of the layout file are listed in :doc:`/reference/files`.
