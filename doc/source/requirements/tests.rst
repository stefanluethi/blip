Test Cases
==========

.. test:: Simulator bridge streams values
   :id: TEST_BRIDGE_SIM
   :status: implemented
   :component: bridge
   :verifies: REQ_BRIDGE_SIM, REQ_PROTO_CBOR

   ``bridge/tests/test_bridge.py::test_simulator_bridge`` -- connects a
   WebSocket client to the bridge in simulator mode and checks that valid
   CBOR messages are received.

.. test:: Simulator bridge streams logs
   :id: TEST_BRIDGE_SIM_LOGS
   :status: implemented
   :component: bridge
   :verifies: REQ_BRIDGE_SIM, REQ_PROTO_CBOR

   ``bridge/tests/test_bridge.py::test_simulator_bridge_logs`` -- connects a
   WebSocket client to the bridge in simulator mode and checks that well-formed
   ``Log`` records are received.

.. test:: Stream values encode as plain CBOR
   :id: TEST_PROTO_DATA
   :status: implemented
   :component: proto
   :verifies: REQ_PROTO_TYPES, REQ_PROTO_CBOR

   ``proto/src/data.rs`` unit tests -- encode every kind of ``Data`` to the
   expected CBOR bytes, round-trip nested arrays and records, and reject byte
   strings, non-text map keys, duplicate fields and integers out of range.
